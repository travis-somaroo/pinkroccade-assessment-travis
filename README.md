# How to run

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## 1. Set Up the Database

Set up the database using Docker Compose. This is needed before you start the application.

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file. This file should be located
   at the root of your project.

Run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```

Once the container is running you can press start in the main method.
